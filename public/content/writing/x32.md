### As part of my work as a UX/UI Designer, I had the opportunity to conceptualize a modern update to [Behringer’s X32 console](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=0603-ACE). The focus was on integrating a touch screen interface to enhance accessibility and efficiency for users, while also delivering a sleek, visually refined interface that aligns with contemporary design standards.

## **Design Process and Key Highlights**

#### **Empathize and Define**

To ensure the redesign addressed real user needs, I conducted a deep dive into the workflows of audio engineers and musicians. This process revealed pain points in the existing interaction model, particularly around the precision and speed required for Equalizer (EQ) adjustments.

> Based on these insights, I defined a clear design goal:\
> *"Create an intuitive and efficient touch-based interface that improves user experience and simplifies parameter adjustments."*

#### **Ideation and Prototyping**

Starting with a hand-drawn wireframe, I explored the idea of a touch-enabled EQ graph that allows users to manipulate audio parameters directly. This led to the development of clear **signifiers**—visual indicators that guide users in interacting with controls like gain, frequency, and Q-factor.

To optimize usability, I designed two layout variations for the controls panel:

1. **Version A:** Placing parameter controls at the top of the screen for quick visibility.

2. **Version B:** Moving the controls to the bottom for a more ergonomic touch experience.

#### **Testing and Iteration**

Through **A/B testing**, I evaluated both layouts, measuring their impact on user performance and satisfaction. These iterative cycles informed key refinements, ensuring the interface was not only functional but also delightful to use.

#### **High-Fidelity Prototype and Use Cases**

Using **MarvelApp**, I developed a high-fidelity prototype that illustrated key scenarios, such as:

* Dragging and adjusting EQ parameters in real-time.

* Resetting and saving custom presets.

* Seamless navigation across multiple audio channels.

These use cases were crucial for validating the design’s effectiveness and ensuring a seamless user experience across various workflows.
